11-04-17 - Tuesday

  - attended IT huddle to get feeling for what is happening on IT's side (Alex focussing on CI regarding Truckmate)
  
  Weekly One-on-One
    - What went well:   Hitting milestones for PnLs/Budgets + providing additional value (employee tenure report)
    - What didn't:      Providing leadership in the team (feedback: even 5 mins a week helps)
    - Things raised:
      - Customer grouping updates; to be handled by Sales (Tim) instead of Marileze
      - GL-Reset Rules and Backloading: supposed to be commodity code 'backloading'
      - Further additions to PnLs/budgets: contract labour + subbies
      - Process for keeping raw data for revenue cube kicked off with Marileze
      - Crackers not responding to meeting request for change to monthly workshop PnL; process of washbay runsheets
      - Customer grouping in revenue cube and grouping in Truckmate possibly misaligned
      - Training requirement: SQL Intermediate, slated for after June
      - Revenue cube needs to be remodeled but lack of time preventing it
      - Equipment by depot and age report is value-add but again lack of time critical
      - Jay started to provide analysis into monthly reports; going forward (after PnL rebuild) will be focus
    - Action items:
      - Focus: Workshop cost allocation to branches
      - Read through Dan Collins material and prepare next Tuesday's meeting (one-on-one)
      - Clarify with Trent focus for coming weeks and discuss contract labour + subbie costs for PnLs/Budgets
      - Laying groundwork on SQL knowledge to prepare for Intermediate SQL training to come
    - Waiting:
      - IT costs to come from Kitty for PnLs/Budgets
      - Contract labour costs to be added ot PnLs/Budgets; info to come from Jay
     - Notes
      - Jay reiterated that he is there for me to talk to if needed (on a personal level - assumption: part of his leadership focus)
